Case 3: Vigenere Cipher Decryption
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table. The table consists of the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, and each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar Ciphers.
At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows.
The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.
For generating a key, the given keyword is repeated circularly until it matches the length of the plain text.

Tasks
Given the above description of the Vigenère cipher, create a C++ program that encrypts and decrypts a message from the user.
Test the program to verify that the output is accurate. Assess program limitations.
Provide documentation that entails a programming approach for encryption and decryption.
